# Introduction to Exploit Development

## Buffer Overflows Explained

### Anatomy of Memory

The section of memory that we are trying to exploit is the section called
the **stack**, or the portion of memory closest to the kernel. Let's break
down the parts of the stack. The registers in the stack are:

- **ESP (Extended Stack Pointer**. 

- **Buffer Space**

- **EBP (Extended Base Pointer)**

- **EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer)/Return Address**

## Spiking

Spiking sends a series of values at a command on a machine to see if you
can "overflow the buffer".
